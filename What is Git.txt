git status - shows all files were updated,created,deleted but still havent saved on the commit yet.

untracked

git add . to track all files in here

or

git add index.html


after git status and all color green, they are ready to be commited coz it is alr tracked in git


git commit -m "Added index.html" -m "some description"

in order to push u need first to prove u are the owner of acc u need 

*using ssh keys 
*generating key locally using ssh key , specify encryption in -t rsa -b idk imnot shor but ganon:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "kmarianu@gmail.com"



default file for the ssh key is 
(/Users/name/.ssh/id-rsa)

enter file in whioch to save key: testkey


ls | grep testkey

napangalan q ata ey nag bug

ls to check test key 
dalawa dapat un
testKey
testKey.pub

testKey.pub is the key that you are going to upload to ur github interface. oki lang makita ibang tao

ung walang .pub ung private key. you have to keep secure in ur machine. 

everytime u want to connect to github/ push/ use ur account via local machine. u use private key to show github that u are the one who generated this key

cat.testkey.pub 
*shows pub key


copy yung key, wag ctrl c (iba yon sa terminal.
or use 
pbcopy < ~/testKey.pub
dapat ata less than symbol kaya not wokring for me; ctrl c works fine for me tho


go github
settings/shs and gpg keys

paste dun yung shs key then save

//now make sure local CLI knows about the key you just generated
